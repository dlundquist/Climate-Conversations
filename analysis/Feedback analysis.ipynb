      "\t *  Over the holiday break, I convinced my family to try the app on the evening of Thanksgiving. I interviewed my father (Jon, 54), mother (Melonie, 54), and brother (Luke, 21). I have ten of my fifteen credits dedicated to the topic of climate change (ATM S 111 and ENGL 199) so this is a topic that I feel strongly about even though my family isn't exposed to it in the slightest way. \n",
      "\n",
      "I was tentative going into the conversation because I know that my family doesn't have the same views on science that I do; \"Christians tend to deny climate change and accept that everything happens for a reason.\" I was pleasantly surprised to find that the questions asked steered the conversation in a gentle and unbiased way. It was easier for my family to answer questions honestly rather than being wary about their answer being pushed in one direction. It provided a smooth platform for me to interject and offer a different solution, fact, or opinion that I've learned during my education here at UW. \n",
      "\n",
      "Everyone in my family tends to think that what ever they know is true no matter what; it's their way or the highway. Because of this, the conversation was more serious because with every answer they provided, they also gave an explanation for why they were right (which was rare). I had to act as a mediator at times because they would interrupt each other and bicker when it wasn't their turn to answer a question. It was difficult to not become aggravated at times because the knowledge and awareness of climate change in my family was so narrow. I had to remind myself that this is a big issue when talking about climate change, though, and accept that just because they don't agree with me now doesn't mean that they can't grow and learn, too. \n",
      "\n",
      "\t *  Most of our conversation was lighthearted because all participants were my family members who all believe in climate change and that actions must be taken to counteract its negative effects. Our conversation did become more serious when we discussed the irreversible damage that may have already been caused by climate change. \n",
      "\n",
      "\t *  My group consisted of close friends and my sister. Overall, it was more informative and light hearted than a serious discussion.  \n",
      "\n",
      "\t *  It was definitely more lighthearted initially, as I already previously knew that my family doesn't take climate change super seriously. Some questions led to more discussion than others while when I tried to push back and challenge my family with statistics on some questions, they would be skeptical and shrug it off. It is frustrating to try to have conversations about climate change with them because they aren't really open to learning more and instead dismiss my points, so having this medium where actual questions were presented instead of me just trying to persuade them was very helpful. Some questions about international policies are ones I've brought up before, especially given this presidency, and they always are quick to defend the position that sometimes other things are more important (i.e. ISIS) when the two are not even comparable or meant to be compared. \n",
      "I did try to be more respectful during this conversation than I have been before, as I usually get pretty easily heated and upset with my family and their lack of consideration for my opinions. I understand that this is a more difficult issue for some to grasp and denial does seem like the easier route because it means not having to change anything about your lifestyle and therefore I was more mindful of the things they were saying and I tried to understand what made them think that way.  \n",
      "\n",
      "\t *  I talked to my three older sisters. The conversation was light and not too serious. This was because it was between family and I decided to discuss it casually while we were hanging out. It is easy to talk to my sisters about this kind of stuff because we generally all have the same views when it comes to climate change. \n",
      "\n",
      "There were moments when things got more serious because my sisters are very passionate about climate change. Certain questions that had to do more with politics steered our convo into a more political arena and that's where the most heated parts of the discussion happened because we don't believe politicians are doing enough to stop climate change. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\t *  The overall conversation went greater than I expected. I never had a conversation with my family regarding the issue of climate change when we all contributed or shared our thoughts. It was usually just me ranting about current climate situation or how our family isn't environmentally friendly enough. The conversation was pretty serious with the mix of humor.\n",
      "Our family have a tendency to not bring up any serious or controversial topics both because we're not interested and we're not a very big fan of debates or arguments. However, the word \"conversation\" definitely made things easier for the members in our family to actually open up to start the conversation and applications like this is definitely helpful to avoid the awkwardness in the middle of the conversations since everything is done by the app. \n",
      "\n",
      "\t *  I was talking with family members, which allowed the conversation to be mostly light hearted. Some people in my family take climate change and politics more seriously than others, which affected the direction of the conversation. For example, my brother who is 16 doesn’t know much about climate change and we have never talked about it together before. He also doesn’t follow the politics of the issue, and I believe in some ways he minimizes it as a serious issue. On the other hand, my mom follows the issue of climate change more closely in terms of the political aspects and is more concerned with its relevance to society. \n",
      "\n",
      "Because of the differing knowledge and investments in the issue of climate change, different family members would shift the direction of the conversation. My brother would often take questions more lightheartedly, while my mom was really invested in expressing her opinions and taking the conversation seriously. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\t *  I talked with some of my cluster mates. Everyone took it relatively seriously, but there were a few jokes here and there (about Al Gore, etc.) When I asked the questions, many people gave thought provoking responses. For example, when asked about the Maori tribe in New Zealand and their relationship with their sacred river, many of my cluster mates found the court ruling to be kind of 'dumb'. However, one person brought up the point that maybe the tribe used the river for survival (food, water). After that, many people agreed that treating the river with the utmost respect is important.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many people confessed to knowing very little about climate change. They said that it was hard to find a readable article on climate change that wasn't incredibly biased and therefore untrustworthy. They said that the information is definitely out there, but all the papers, articles, etc. about climate change that are trustworthy are written in 'scientific language' (language that the average person would not understand).\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, I thought the conversation went very well. There was just enough of a serious tone to have a legitimate discussion, but it wasn't too much where a person felt uncomfortable sharing his opinion. \n",
      "\n",
      "\t *  The conversation was very casual. I was with mostly family and we all have very similar opinions about climate change and it’s effects. \n",
      "\n",
      "\t *  These conversations went very well. The tone of the conversation was very lighthearted and fun, however we all care about the environment so we were answering the questions seriously. The questions were able to spark some fun conversations and stories.\n",
      "\n",
      "For answering all of the questions on this app, I was talking with family members. I got together with my brother, and my two cousins, and we are all around the same age range. My youngest cousin is 16, and my brother is the oldest who is 23. I think it would have been more interesting to have a variety of ages, so the app would share facts from different generations. \n",
      "\n",
      "\t *  For the most part my conversation was light-hearted and fun. I talked with my immediate family. Because we all know each other well, we did not have an issue answering the questions honestly. I think this allowed us to get pretty in depth on some of the questions and learn more about our personal experiences. I think it was interesting to see the difference between the knowledge we had of climate science. Even though we all have similar opinions about the existence and severity of climate change, the depth of our knowledge very a lot between members. Because we all had similar opinions, the conversation was mostly lighthearted-when we were not contemplating too much about the end of the world. \n",
      "It would have been interesting to have a conversation like this with people who did not share similar opinions about climate change. Because the questions are pretty neutral, it would be interesting to see the answers and then have a conversation about the politics and science of climate change. I have found that it is beneficial to talk to people you disagree with and I think completing this activity with someone I disagree with would help me see a different perspective and also solidify my beliefs.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\t *  Because I played the game with my family members the conversation was pretty lighthearted. Nobody really got too heated about the discussion. The question that got everyone involved was the question asking if people everywhere should pay for polluting the air. We discussed various ways the payment plan could be implemented and which way would be most effective. Different political views definitely had an impact on how the payments would be implemented. \n",
      "\n",
      "Some topics became serious, like the question about Katrina. One of my good friends in elementary school moved to New Orleans 4 months before the storm hit. His family lost everything and had to move to his grandparents in Las Vegas. My friends and I organized a bake sale to help his family out. We raised $1,700 which at the time to us was a boatload of money. His family visited us and said thank you afterwards.\n",

      "\n",
      "\t *  Overall, I would say that the conversation was not as productive as it could have been. This was because my family members are not very knowledgeable about the science of global warming. This lack of knowledge made the whole conversation surface level, because, even when I tried to explain topics, like natural climate cycles, my family members would not easily abandon their misconceptions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some of these misconceptions included the beliefs that global warming would lead to more hurricanes, or that the recent drought in California was caused by global warming. My family members believe in climate change, but they tend to take a doomsday-like, overdramatic stance, taking everything they hear in the media as truth. \t\n",
      "\n",
      "Regardless of our disagreements, the conversation was respectful, and we were all in agreement over basic claims, such as the importance of addressing global warming as a society.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\t *  The conversations were often lighthearted. As I told the different scenarios my family would often joke around about how old certain family members were. In addition to this, my family would joke around and say things like \"Climate change doesn't exist\" and that climate change is just a joke so the government can make more money. \n",
      "Aside from all the jokes being told, with each new scenario I asked, I noticed that my family was giving honest answers and that new people were gathering around to listen and add their opinion too. In the end, I was only interviewing 3 people but about 10 people were sitting around the conversation adding in their opinion too. \n",
      "Often times the answers were very honest and people disagreed with each other in what they thought would be the best answer. For example the app asked if the rights of people and bodies of water are the same as the rights of people and business. Many people debated whether those two should be iterated the dame or not.  \n",
      "\n",
      "\t *  I completed this assignment with my mom and step dad at the dinner table at home. The conversation went really well and I was surprised at how much my family knew about global warming already. I was also pleased with how willing they were for me to teach them about what I have been learning in this class. For example, my mom believed that CO2 was causing the ozone layer to open, and I took that opportunity to explain to her how CFCs were actually the cause of the hole in the ozone layer, and how that problem has been virtually solved (the ozone layer will be completely closed by 2060).\n",
      "\n",
      "It was fun to have the opportunity to discuss a topic that I am passionate about with the people that I care about. I value my family's opinions and I'm thankful that they value mine and were willing to listen to what I have been learning about in this class. It was interesting to hear the opinions of two people who have not recently taken any classes about global warming. I'm glad that we were all respectful of each other's opinions, especially when they did not completely line up with one another's beliefs. Thus, the conversation we had was fairly serious and even sobering at times, but overall we all agreed that it was very interesting and fun to discuss the complex and divisive topic of global warming. \n",
      "\n",
      "\t *  The conversations were serious, because all of us are really into this topic. It does have an impact on us and in our society. We talked about our concerns and talked about what we thought were the causes. It was good to have a serious conversation because it’s something we don’t often get to talk about. With so much going on, this kind of survey/game is a good chance for people to notice the issues because they often don’t get talked about in a serious way. We can look at different opinions and changes we have noticed/impacts from global warming.\n",
      "I decided to interview my younger brother first because when I told him I was taking the course, he told me that he wanted to be updated on what we learned about every week and the causes of global warming. He is very into science and interested in this topic. Apparently they mention global warming at his high school but not deeply enough about the topic. He is very concerned about what is going to affect the future of planet and how. He is worried about what the outcome of the planet will be. What he believes he knows about global warming is what he sees in the media and when the movies make false outcomes from global warming and how it makes them suddenly end the world and everything. He used to believe those sort of movies but because he doesn't get taught that much about this, he can only believe what is given to him. But this talk allowed us to clear things up and I would just wish that they would teach more about global warming and the causes/ outcomes in schools so it doesn't create these false assumptions. Especially recently with the hurricanes that have been happening and everyone believing that global warming causes many more hurricanes. But really the hurricanes are expected to increase in intensity but not in number. Without experts telling us this, people wouldn't even know and would assume, global warming is causing more hurricanes. Which is why talking about this could help people understand the topics. \n",
      "I also interviewed my mom and dad. I think interviewing both of them was helpful because they have been in Seattle for a very long time and they have seen the changes that have been happening, since they have lived in the same area most of their lives. I thought that talking to them would be a good idea because they don't necessarily talk about global warming and I don't think people have that much knowledge about it, and believe false things like what we see in the movies, aka \"2012,\" and \"The Day After Tomorrow.\" Of course I care about them and wanted to talk to them about what is going and the changes happening, what actually is causing global warming and how we can change the way we live.  All of our talks were mostly fun and serious to help each other make sense of it and very eye opening. \n",

      "\t *  \tMy conversation was with family: two of my sisters, one of which is also in ATM S 111, and my brother eventually joined later on. All topics that we discussed were rather short and to the point, as we found that not many questions were very thought-provoking, and we almost always agreed with each other on what the ‘correct’ answer was, requiring no additional discussion.\n",
      "\tThe talks were generally lighthearted, though not in a fun sort of way. There was no joking around, but it wasn’t as serious as one may expect when talking about the tragedies of hurricanes/extended droughts/etc. Our conversations were very detached from thoughts of humanity and pathos; everything was approached from a logical/statistical point of view. \n",
      "\n",
      "\t *  For this conversation I talked with my mom, brother, and sister. So I was only talking with family. The conversation was serious in that we were all concerned about the future of global warming and how it is going to impact all of us and our future children. It was not serious though in that we did not have many differing opinions. I feel like we all talked and were able to come to conclusions for each question. This may be just because we are family and get along well and all have similar viewpoints. \n",
      "\n",
      "The conversation overall was pretty fun and educational. I was able to share with my family some of the things I have been learning in Global Warming and educate them on things happening around us everyday that they may have never even known about. My younger brother who is 14 definitely learned the most I think, and it was interesting to hear his take on everything. My mom had a lot of interesting points as well because she is older and has witnessed a lot more with climate change than me and my siblings have.  \n",
      "\n",
      "\t *  It was alright. I invited some of my roommates to do the conversation with me. Considering how they tend to have an opinion on the current world, they enjoyed it much more than myself.  The conversation veered off into different directions (side tangents), but it was not due to the game. It was just that we were much more interested in other topics at times. \n",
      "\n",
      "It was kinda fun. The topic of global warming tends to be more dark and negative, due to the pessimistic forecasts from scientists. The topics acted as an interesting starter to conversations we wouldn't have had otherwise, though. Overall, the ability to force conversation on the topic is good, but my friends and I already agree with climate change.  \n",
      "\n",
      "\t *  Living in an apartment of eight, I asked a few of my roommates to play the game. The conversation started with an awkward touch that slowly entered a fun and lighthearted mood. Rather than making the conversation depressing due to the topic being global warming, we decided that we would make this time as serious, yet enjoyable as possible. Though we sometimes ended up swaying off topic, the questions were enough to keep us going. I was afraid that my roommates would not want to participate, but they told me that they value the environmental changes of global warming on a large scale. \n",
      "One of the topics that one of my roommates brought up was the fact that her family owns one of the Jamba Juices in Washington. There was a question about the average surface temperature of the Earth becoming warmer, and if winters feel different than they used to. She stated that although she and her family worries about the effects of climate change, sometimes her family was happy that the winters were feeling warmer. The rest of us were very surprised by this claim, and asked her why. She explained that because the drinks their family sold was generally cold, the warmer climate would increase their business. It seemed ridiculous at first, but she had seen business rise on warmer days, versus colder days. I thought this was extremely interesting, but “messed up” in its own way. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\t *  I used family members along with my boyfriend to answer the questions about climate change. I found that at first the conversation started out as more humorous and that they didn't take it seriously, but most of that could have been the fact that I forced them into this conversation. as the questions went on they got competitive about who could know the most and give me the best answers and so they then paid more attention and seemed to care more. once they started to answer with the best of their abilities the other people would try to fact check them and question anything that was uncertain or sounded false. \n",
      "I found that unless people are constantly reminded of the issue of global warming they tend to be careless on the issue. No one wanted to talk about it when i brought it up and asked them too. they acted as if it was a pointless waste of their time. based on how my conversations went I think if others were to talk about global warming they would find that they care more than they think and change could be brought about. other family members started to join in and take sides on the \"debate\". \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\t *  My conversation went well. For the most part, they were fairly lighthearted however many of the people I talked with recognized the importance or integral roll global warming plays in modern day society. Many of the questions asked were related to the age of the person I was interviewing. This definitely helped create a dialogue between me and the interviewee as the questions asked related to a time period where they had some degree of familiarity. \n",
      "\n",
      "The scope of people I interviewed varied from friends, close family, and one person who is in the ATM 111 class. They all had varying opinions on the questions I asked. However, it seemed that the younger the age of the person I interviewed, the more concern they expressed towards global warming.    \n",
      "\n",
      "\t *  When using this app I thought it would be interesting to hear what my friends had to say about the issue of global warming seeing as I feel very strongly, but I wanted to hear their views and opinions on the matter. It started out as a pretty lighthearted and interesting talk but pretty soon we realized we had some slightly different views, especially since we grew up in different place, and it became a more serious conversation. \n",
      "\n",
      "Two us are from the Seattle area and have grown up around this issue pretty much our whole lives and felt pretty strongly about things dealing with cutting emissions no matter the price. However, one of my other friends is from Spokane and she agreed with most of what we were saying but told us all about her own family and how they barley recycle or compost there and so, while she agrees in global warming, has a harder time agreeing to the different ways we might help. Lastly, one of my friends is from Idaho where they do no recycle at all and her family has almost no concept of going green and helping the environment. While she is more environmentally conscientious than them, she was raised in an environment where global warming was not an issue and this has become ingrained in a part of her. This meant while she agrees that global warming was real she couldn't quite get on board with a lot of the solutions presented in the questions.  \n",
      "\n",
      "\t *  At first, my friends were not really into playing this game, as they didn’t care much about what global warming or climate change. But I think at least they tried to answer the question after they thought for a while. In general, they share some concern toward environmental friendly method.\n",
      "Since I attended ATMs class, I was explaining most questions and leading how conversations go. One of my friend’s attitude toward global warming is still unchanged, even after the game, as he claimed that nature itself had bigger effect on global warming.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\t *  I think it was very informative and gave us all motivation to take this issue more seriously than we do on a regular basis. I was talking to a few friends about it, all of whom are about my age (19), so it gave hope that our future would be bright since we will take more action. We all realized that global warming affects us more than we may have initially thought. \n",
      "\n",
      "\t *  Our conversation was both lighthearted and serious. I did the game with  my dad, brother, and Aunt. My dad and brothers both are more conservative and uneducated on climate change in general, whereas my Aunt has a degree in science and is well versed on the matter. It wasn't as fun in general because the topic were rather controversial and my dad's views differ so heavily from me and my aunt's. My brother really made us laugh however when we were discussing whether rivers have the same rights as a person--he thought it was a really absurd question and couldn't seriously answer it. My dad was the same way. \n",
      "\n",
      "Each of my family members know each other really well, so we're aware of what exactly gets on each other's nerves. I found that had arisen in the conversation but on the other end we also made each other laugh in certain ways. My aunt in general really enlightened us because of her intelligence in subjects related to the atmosphere and topics we've learned in Dragon's global warming course as well. I was happy to be with her in California and talk with her about it! \n",
      "\n",
      "\t *  I chose to talk with y family members. The conversation was a little fun and serious at the same time. It was fun because we pointed out how each one of us could make better choices regarding global warming. Also, it was serious because the town where I am from does not really stress recycling and ways to make the planet greener, so it was great getting to explain to my family members  the way one can start practicing recycling on their own. This I believe is something very important and something I would bring to the attention of my city hall. I believe it wouldn't have been as fun of a conversation if I would have done this with acquaintances, because in a family you get a sense of everyone and can therefore add personal experiences making the conversation more deep. \n",
      "\n",
      "\t *  The conversation went great! My father, who was apart of the conversation has always heard of global warming, but never got a proper chance to have an educational conversation about the topic. My sister, on the other hand, has read about global warming through articles and other sources and was very skeptical about it. My friend Mohamed is a firm believer that global warming is occurring he was just more confused on what is causes and effects.\n",
      " The conversation we had was serious, because the people I was speaking to hadn't known the drought in CA was and effect of global warming, and some of them didn't really believe our carbon footprint is the cause of global warming. Through our conversation we were able to debunk myths and get to the reality of the issue, which they all appreciated greatly.  \n",
      "\n",
      "\t *  The conversations went very well I think. I was talking with family members, and coming from a relatively liberal household we have similar beliefs. Although the age differences between my parents and me and my siblings definitely gave us different perspectives on global warming. It was good that we were all talking with family members because no one is going to take anything personally, and what we all want is to become a more aware and educated family, so this exercise was very helpful and constructive. In addition, since we are all comfortable with criticizing one another this allowed us to create a platform where thoughts that aren’t backed by science or are faulty, could be changed with science.\n",
      "\n",
      "We all tried to keep it lighthearted and everyone was encouraged to speak any doubts about what was being said, and told that there were no wrong questions or answers. This made it very easy for my younger sister, who has the least amount of knowledge about global warming to express any preconceived notions she may have, and also put herself in the shoes of people who are already being affected by this phenomenon. No one in my family is a doubter of global warming so no ones opinions needed to be changed, but these questions made us think deeply about the impacts it may have not just on our lives, but on peoples lives all around the world.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\t *  Our conservation was filled with various types of reactions .There were times where it was filled with laughter to due to the confusion on the subject . At others times there was concerned about our future and the impact that global warming would have on our environment . Others were careless about the subject because they believed that there is nothing more that we can do as humans to stop global warming , in a way they have lost hope in the revival of the ecosystem.  \n",
      "I had this conversation with my three family members. There were different ages that ranged from 16 , 23, and 47 .My mother , brother , and cousin were all very open to the topic of Global Warming . They all have heard about global warming but had little knowledge about the subject .  We all agreed that global warming is caused by humans .   \n",
      "\n",
      "\t *  I used the climate conversation app with 2 other of my apartment mates and we had a brief conversation about the topics that were shown relative to our ages and how it affected us. While it was fun and not very serious when I first asked them the questions and prompts, it gradually got more and more serious as we got deeper into the conversation. Global warming is a topic where the issues affect everybody in the world whether they like it or not, so many people do have opinions that they might not share unless prompted to; for example for this game. \n",

We hypothesized how concrete and achievable our answers were and we discussed ripple effects. We built on the questions to other ideas and talked more. The only problem was that when we gave an answer, the method on how to implement it seemed unrealistic. We were very passionate and serious about the conversation but it seems far fetched. It was a lighthearted conversation for the most part but we ran into some disagreements. When that happened, we kind of laughed it off and moved on. Seemed like we avoided some hard to answer questions where after a while, we just decided to move on. It was humorous at times for when we were really stumped on a question and had no idea how realistic it would be, we made funny jokes about how it could be implemented.

I was speaking with my immediate family, all of whom look at climate science and the environment with great importance. For the most part, we agree that the biggest differences need to come from regulations on carbon emissions, not just in our country but around the globe. Though individuals matter too, and we discussed some ways that we could minimize our own family's impact, such as eating less meat.\n",

When we talked about storing carbon in the ground, which we had vague background knowledge on, our conversation went lighthearted and just talked about what was best for the environment and how storing carbon was a good thing. We went from talking how trees and plants take in carbon dioxide into how the land has a limit on how much carbon can be taken in. Another conversation that we took lighthearted was the IPCC because once again we had no background knowledge on what it is, so we just briefly answered the question. Also, for lighthearted question, we searched up Google on stuff in order to understand the topic. For example, for the noble prize question, we were confused on what is a peace prize and noble prize of science, so we answered it light-heartedly and just gave a reasonable answer. Questions that we took seriously are questions we discussed in class or something we have knowledge of. Especially things like the pollution or natural disasters, we took them pretty seriously as these topics appear in news, our class, and other social media sites. Sometimes, some questions made us off track, which we started discussing about other things that are relatable to the topic but not really answer the question.

There were some questions where we would go beyond what we were asked and try to find solutions to the questions. Sometimes we would go off topic as well since there would be some things that were mentioned that were not really related to the question at hand but we would talk about that anyways. There were some questions that we couldn't  really relate to so we quickly answered that question and went on to the next one. Some of the questions that we skipped were events that we didn't remember. Other questions were asking if we knew people that had events happen to. For most of the events, we didn't know anyone who had lived through those events. \n",

The question asked about plants in parks in homes and parks. We started to talk about how plants were suited to the climates here and would not die. Then we somehow turned to growing plants and how easy it would be to grow then. Then the conversation went on to growing succulents if we wanted easy plants to grow and that wouldn't need much care. Then it somehow turned to how one of my friends grew succulents before and it died within a week.  \n",

We also talked about how each power source that provides electricity affects our environment. \n",

Sometimes like the questions on Katrina or other climate change events that led many people's deaths, we discussed quite seriously. I think most of time, we tried to figure out difference between the Nobel prize and the peace prize. \n",

Just kidding, I just never saw those aspects of them. It was really fun.\n",

I remembered when we were sharing our experience of warming back in our own towns, there were a lot of similarities, even though we came from different latitudes. As a subtropical kid, I'd noticed shorter and humider winter during the past several years. Those days were unbearable and painful, as I prayed the weather could get colder everyday. I used to think that was just normal temperature swings, but they offered me the same observations, like even though at the north part of China, the winter got shorter and shorter each year.

We went through the scenarios and answered the questions provided. The conversation didn't really start until we reached a familiar event that happened to one of us before.  \n",
      "\n",
      "\t *  Since the conversation was going on during the holiday, the tone of the conversation was kind of relaxable but mixed with some seriousness when touching some important topics. I was talking with my roommates who is all current university students. Our responses all come both from our educational background and from the knowledge that we exchanged during that conversation. \n",
      "\n",
      "\t *  The conversation was between me and my fraternity brothers as we spent Thanksgiving break together. As much as I believed it to be short, quick answers that had little thought or specifics involved, I was wrong. The conversations for each round were very serious as my brothers evidently take Climate Change to heart and have quite specific opinions on each controversial issue in relation to it. \n",
      "\n",
      "There were times that we disagreed, yet kept it at a conversation, not argumentative, level. That was expected, though, and I was super excited to see how engaged all of my brothers got while different questions were proposed. It is nice to know that there are people who care as much as I do when it comes to saving our planet, or at least impacting it, before our death. Ultimately it was nice to have this conversation with my brothers and see where more of their morals and values are! \n",
      "\n",
      "\t *  The conversation overall was pretty good. I don't think that there was an overall tone that I could qualify the conversation to be, as it was pretty much a mix of everything. There were jokes here and there, but also occasions where there was still some serious discussion around what was going on in the real world and how things are changing and how that will impact not only our lives but the lives of other people around the world. I did this with friends, so in other words people with the same sorts of interests as me and around the same age, so my sample is probably not the most representative.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think also it's good to have a more lighthearted approach in certain times, as this is meant to be a game, after all. Of course I don't think that everything should be lighthearted as there are drastic consequences to events that are going on currently, but I also find value in just having a good time with people and talking about interesting issues is pretty neat. \n",
      "\n",
      "\t *  I was talking with my friends, and the conversation went lighthearted. I think the reason is mostly because every time when they say something the conversation flowed into wrong direction. They did not stick on the topic.  \n",
      "During the conversation I really felt that people really do not care about the global warming. I think I should have made some friends from this class and talked with them for more serious conversation. However they made the conversation funnier than it would be. \n",
      "\n",
      "\t *  The conversation was at times humorous and at times serious. I played this game with my friends. It would get serious because we would debate about what we believed was the right solution. It was also interesting and sometimes shocking to hear what other people had to say about the specific event. My friends come from different backgrounds, therefore, they all had different views. Because of that, the conversation would sometimes be funny due to various interesting responses. \n",
      "The conversation made me realize how much this class has actually taught me. I found it interesting because some of my friends were not as concerned with who's responsibility it would be to take care of our air. This reminded me of the tragedy of the commons and how it is a real issue. Some people simply do not feel that they are responsible for things such as air because it is so abundant and everywhere. No one can claim air as their own so it is hard to decide who has to be responsible for it. These thoughts were interesting to me.  \n",
      "\n",
      "\t *  For my conversation I was talking with my younger brother and dad. I felt it was important to have a difference in generations, so we could gain input both from how me and my brother feel about the topic as teenagers, as well as my dad who has been exposed to different politicians, media sources and science surrounding the topic as he grew up. The conversation was focused, but lighthearted as my dad reflected and shared some funny stories regarding the perception of climate change when he was younger. \n",
      "\n",
      "I was glad I had this conversation with family members because I was free to share exactly what I felt with no reservations. If I were to have this conversation with people I was not as close with, I feel I would not be able to get into the same level of depth of conversation. I also believe that would be true for the others I had my conversation with. Conversely, it may be better to have these conversations with people you are not close with or do not know very well. The benefits of doing it with people you are not as close with would be that they could offer different perspective or have more experience in a field than people in your family. Regardless, the app provides thought provoking questions and encourages engagement on important topics. \n",
      "\n",
      "\t *  My conversation between my brother and sister went smoother than expected. At first, it was tough to find time where all of us were free, but then they made some time for me (roughly 30 mins) and went into depth of how we feel towards certain topics. While most of the discussions we had were fairly serious, we had fun with it as well. Here and there we would crack jokes, but a few times we also thought hypothetically and how the world would be different, if at all, if their current views were in place rather than how most of the world views a topic.\n",
      "\n",
      "\tThere were some questions/scenarios that I couldn’t relate to, nor did I have much of an answer to other than ‘no’, but to hear the other side of the story broadened my perspective. Far too often, myself included, we stand so firmly in what we believe in that we don’t consider the other side of an argument. While having passion for a side is completely fine, we let this “passion” blind us in a way. This passion makes us one-sided and fail to be considerate of what others may believe/think, and I think that’s a flaw many of us carry along with us. \n",
      "\n",
      "\t *  The conversations went fairly well. I talked with two of my closest sorority sisters - one from Northern California and the other from around Woodinville, WA. Since we are so close with each other, we felt free to express our opinions on certain topics and not have to worry about being criticized. The conversation definitely switched back between serious to more lighthearted because none of us are experts on really any of the topics. None of them have taken an atmospheric science class yet either so they didn't know a whole lot of scientific reasoning/evidence for the topics so the conversations were pretty surface level or based on our own personal experience. Overall, I would say it was a nice conversation to have and to see the opinions of my closest friends and the people I'm living with. \n",

      "\n",
      "\t *  My conversations with my family, (mom, dad and brother) went really well. I was surprised by how informed they were on these topics. It was funny at times but also we got into some deeper conversations. There were sometimes when one person did not feel the same way but was open to listening to other ideas. \n",
      "I think this conversation was good to have and it should be more prevalent because it really was not “scary” or anything it was just talking and sharing information. The reason so many people do not understand what is going on with the climate right now is because we don’t like to talk about these things. However, I am glad this site helped foster those conversations which lead into conversations about other topics too. \n",
      "\n",
      "\t *  The conversation went well. I did it with my family, my mom, my brother and one of my friends. My mom was very interested in the conversation and the topic of climate change. It was lighthearted and everyone seemed to care about the issues at hand. At many points people in the conversation people were surprised and learned new things they haven't done before. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\t *  I used this app during Thanksgiving with my family members.  It was a pretty serious discussion, but we all share generally the same stance on global warming and climate change, so it didn't get very heated.  However, the level to which we each view its severity differed, so that was interesting to see.  If I had done this with strangers of different backgrounds, or even gotten my conservative, republican cousin from the South to participate, I definitely think the conversation would've been more intense.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think in general, people don't know a ton about climate change.  Because I am taking this class, I had semi-informed opinions about the questions, but for others, there was stuff in there that they were completely unfamiliar with, and thus couldn't really answer.  I think this demonstrates one of the main issues with global warming; there isn't enough public awareness. \n",
      "\n",
      "\t *  My conversations went really well. I think because they were my friends I could talk to them very openly about my experiences and ask them about theirs. The conversations were very light but serious at times especially when talking about natural disasters. I think that if i talked to family members, I would've gotten more responses about their experiences because they are older and wiser. My friends and I were at the same level really reluctant of understanding global warming issues. But after this experience, we got to see the severity of the issue and reality of it.  \n",
      "\n",
      "\t *  The conversation was relatively light hearted, however there were also serious moments and tones throughout the more serious parts and topics of the conversation. Initially, the conversation began very lighthearted. Because the group I talked with knows each other very well, it was a very relaxed atmosphere. I chose to talk to my friends because of this fact but also because I knew that everyone was comfortable around each other. Because everyone was comfortable with each other, they felt that they were able to share with each other openly and honestly which contributed to the conversation well. \n",
      "\tAs the conversation continued, there were more serious topics and parts of the conversation. These were mainly centered around issues that the group felt impacted them directly as well as their perceived opinions on certain issues. Because the group I chose consisted of college students, they were all relatively educated and aware of many of the issues that we are facing currently. In the group, there were actually a few people who have taken this class previously and were very well informed about the issues and topic.  \n",
      "\n",
      "\t *  When I decided to use the app, I didn't really think it would ask the questions it did and I mostly expected it to ask the generic questions which are mainly present in the media. Our conversations were mainly lighthearted because I was talking to some of my fellow friends, but in some cases they really began to reflect on the consequences that could face us in the future. The discussion became more serious however when given the context of the situation, which was related to our own lives. \n",
      "\n",
      "\t *  It went alright. It started out fun but it definitely turned into something more serious. I was talking with my family, specifically my mother and my grandparents, as well as my boyfriend. When it came to my boyfriend and I, we had very similar views but they differed in quite drastic ways in some points from both my mother and my grandparents. Our different generational views seemed to have big impacts on our thoughts on climate change. For me, I think that they are being stubborn and ignorant to the facts and for them, they think I'm too young and naive to know enough to make an informed decision. \n",
      "The fact that we were talking as a family I think allowed us to be more honest about our opinions, even if they weren't the nicest, because we felt we were in a safe place. I think if I was talking to my friends or strangers the conversation would have gone a lot differently.  If I was talking to my friends I think there would be a lot more agreement and thinking about what we can do as a generation to help the planet instead of just arguing about whether or not climate change even exists or not. With strangers, I think it would be interesting because you would get to talk to people who may have different opinions than you and maybe become more aware of issues you hadn't thought of yet.  \n",

      "\t *  The conversation went well -- I was talking with my mom and two of my friends. All of them are believers in climate change and the fact that humans have a role in climate change, but they were also not extremely knowledgeable about the topic in general. A lot of the questions confused them and led me to have to explain a lot of the concepts I learned in class, but once I explained, they understood the questions and were able to answer it. The main thing that I realized from the conversation was how all three of them, mainly my mom, continued to answer in a way that addressed their concern for climate change, although they weren't too knowledgable about what they were talking about. \n",
      " The conversation was not very lighthearted as well, but also not serious. It was not lighthearted because all three of them did realize that climate change is a serious topic and therefore did not want to treat it as a joke. However, it was not super serious either because none of them were extremely knowledgeable about the topic, so therefore I do not think they truly realize just how harmful and vast climate change is. For example, when my mom asked about the ways in which she thinks population growth will affect her personally, she mentioned things like it being harder for her to travel or it affecting where she wants to live in her retirement. I realized that she doesn't see very much how population growth affects the environment and how it may affect the livelihood or her kids and grand kids.  \n",
      "\n",
      "\t *  I thought that my conversation with my family members went a lot better than expected. I came into it thinking that it would be sort of awkward since everyone has different views on climate change but after we had the discussion I can definitely say it was worthwhile.  All of the members of the conversation were family members. It was my mom, uncle, and cousin. Surprisingly, all of them knew information about the current global warming events that are occurring right now. The conversation was in the middle of light-hearted and serious. Because it was Thanksgiving, everyone was in a joyful mood but in reality, when it comes down to talking about climate change, you cannot take the conversation light-hearted one bit.  \n",
      "We spent well over an hour discussing the impacts not only on our personal lives but people that live in other countries as well. I was able to talk about how I have learned so much in the ATM S 111 course about the impacts of global warming and how Dargan plays his songs after every class period. He truly has made the class an interesting one and a fun environment to be and I was able to relay that to my family members. They all seemed interested and wished they would’ve taken a class similar when they were in college. I think we all realized it’s important to understand the circumstances and current events that surround the topic of global warming and we had productive conversations emphasizing key factors that influence climate change.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\t *  At times, the conversation was serious. I talked with friends, because my family's first language isn't English, so it would be difficult to translate everything (perhaps language barriers might be a reason that not as many people are concerned about climate change). I was talking with friends who all believe in climate change and its impacts, and have prior knowledge on this subject. This could have led to some bias affecting how seriously we took each question, but I felt that we had meaningful, serious discussion about the topics. We were especially serious when talking about issues that concerned the United States, since this country already has so many problems, even theorizing about different solutions to climate change leads to more problems. However, even serious discussions are fun and interesting, though, especially if you are talking about something that you care about and want to talk to other people about.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other times, when the discussion questions were more personal, we answered in more lighthearted ways. We joked around about our experiences and told stories that things that happened to us that related to the question. We made small talk and even mentioned things that seemed to have little significance, but it all tied together to the topic. Sometimes, when questions are more personal and relatable, it makes the situation mentioned in the question seem more real. Because of this, there is a greater feeling of urgency to take action with issues regarding climate change. \n",

      "\t *  It went pretty well. It was humorous and super fun! I was talking with friends in my college and most of us were from the same city or cities with similar climates. \n",

      "\n",
      "\t *  I feel that our conversation went pretty serious. As a family, we are very close knit, so everyone listened carefully with our responses.

I definitely liked that the app got us to keep talking to each other, without me having to find things to talk about.\n",

      "My dad was very supportive of stopping climate change. He does not want us to live in a planet that is in a worse state than how it was when he was young. He tells us to do our best as we grow into adults, to find ways to reverse the effects of climate change. He tells us that we do not want to look back in our lives, and think that we did not give enough efforts to preserve our environment. \n",

      "\t *  the conversation went smoothly and i was talking with three friends. One of my friends did not care about climate change and he thought no matter how the world changed, we still needed to continue our lives; one of my friends did not believe in climate change and he thought climate change was exaggerated by the scientists in order to get more concerns from the public; a friend and i believe that climate change was happening. \n",
      "\n",
      "Everyone shared their own opinions with details and i quite enjoyed discuss  topics like climate change with my friends because it let me think more and see one thing with wider aspects. Even though we may have different ideas on some questions, we did not interrupt others when they shared their opinions. Well, it was just a conversation, right? So, we all had fun and knew more about each other.  \n",
      "\n",
      "\t *  I chose to have a conversation with my family for one of the rounds and I was actually pleasantly surprised by the way they were concerned about climate change and the way it affects us. When the app would use me as an example and say questions such as \"When Clara turned 10, Canadian citizens in British Columbia voted to charge people and companies for dumping carbon pollution into the air\" it placed my parents somewhere and it made them feel more connected to the problem rather than thinking climate change is happening but it doesn't affect them personally. \n",
      "The conversation was mostly lighthearted and fun but there were times where certain topics would come up that my parents didn't know about and they'd be concerned about why this information isn't better displayed for everyone to know about because they said everyone would be trying to help if they realized the severity of pollution and other climate change problems. My parents also don't speak English so whatever news they watch or read is in Spanish and they told me about how climate change issues are minimally presented or sometimes not talked about at all which is concerning because there are a lot of Spanish speaking people living in the United States who aren't being informed of climate change problems the way it deserves to be shared. \n",

      "\t *  It was serious, but fun. I was talking with my immediate family members, and the conversation was respectful and interesting. Some people did not change their opinions on matters after discussion, but we all were able to answer honestly and not feel attacked. This might have been in part because the family I was with is all very close, but some opinions did differ a lot.\n",
      "There was a couple instances where someone came in with an opinion or answer for the question, and was able to listen to another person and add their thoughts in. This was an example of talking about agriculture and who should get the most water; my mom thought that agriculture and dams should be continued in a drought to provide energy and food, but after listening to my brother say how much water food needs to be made and how that can be improved, my mom agreed that was something that could be reduced in order to save water there, by importing more.  \n",
      "\n",
      "\t *  My conversation took place after Thanksgiving, with my boyfriend, mother, and family friends. It was actually very fascinating to hear everyone's responses to current and past issues on our environment on a common ground. My mother is very passionate about saving our atmosphere and being informed in climate change/global warming, and my friends were a lot less informed. \n",
      "\n",
      "Usually my mom informs me on what she hears on the news in a condescending way, assuming that I do not know much about it. But with this app, we were all on a common ground and I was able to speak to my thoughts in a calm manner. I realized that because I never really talk about these issues to my boyfriend and friends, they were a lot less informed than I was, and I think I owe a lot of that to this class. The way the questions were set up informed you on the topic, then asked you questions you were able to relate to, which I think all of us really enjoyed. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\t *  The conversations were very short and not much was said about anything. I believe the reason why this was the case is because of the nature of the questions that the app asked. Most of the questions asked were yes or no questions or other simple questions that can be answered with a few words. This was why it was very lighthearted. \n",
      "Another reason why is that I was talking with friends. I personally know that they are not very passionate or knowledgeable about climate change and thus don't have much to add to the conversation besides the simple answers required of these simple questions.   \n",
      "\n",
      "\t *  Our conversations went really well! It was relatively lighthearted for almost every question after a few minutes of serious conversation and debate. It was fun to watch my Mom and Grandfather talk about how much Seattle has and will continue to change. My little brother, 12, is young but is a lot smarter than many of the kids his age, unfortunately he's aware of this and led to him trying to answer every question. This led to a lot of lead to a lot of learning for both my brother an I. As you can tell from what i've already stated, this conversation was held with strictly my family. I decided that it would probably be taken a bit more seriously if done with my family rather than my friends. It also added an interesting dynamic of time age difference and experience. If I had the chance to do this again I might add one of my friends to add another difference of perspective.  \n",
      "\n",
      "\t *      While talking with my family, the conversations from the climate conversations app were very lighthearted for the most part. Many of the questions are not directly related to climate change which makes for easy conversation to begin with, before transitioning into more climate-focused topics about the event mentioned on the app. This made it easy to start talking, but only when someone had an applicable answer. For example,  the first question my family and I had asked about whether or not anyone we knew had skin cancer linked to sun damage. This question was pretty specific and didn't apply to anyone there, so it was hard to then transition into the main topic of conversation about the ozone because we had nothing to build off of and just started with the next question. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\t *  The conversation is pretty, not too serious. I had the conversation with one of my friend Tina around my age, and my mom. It's very fun to hear different opinions from different generations. My mom does not see global warming or pollution as a too serious issue, and she seems like not care the affect of it for future generations. My friend and I are more concerned on this topic, mainly because we have more education on this topic. \n",
      "\n",
      "\t *  It was serious. My family takes climate change really seriously and it's always a damper on any conversation because we always consider the long run and what Earth will be like when my kids have their own children. We wonder if it's selfish to have kids grow in such a badly polluted Earth. \n",

From my observation, it seemed like they definitely believed in Climate Change but didn't always have facts to back it up, kind of just a general distaste for pollution/coal. It was lighthearted but also serious in the sense that we all really thought about the questions but there wasn't really any arguing because we all agreed. I constantly get into fights about climate change with my dad, who doesn't believe in climate change, despite having his masters in ocean geology. I would love to use this tool with him because I feel like it would moderate conversations and keep us from just yelling at each other. My friends were also asking a lot of questions about solar and wind power, as well as coal use in the US because they genuinely didn't know, so it definitely sparked an interest on their part by allowing them to figure out what they don't know.

So we are all very comfortable talking with each other about the topic of climate change. Our overall conversations about climate change can get very serious. But I think that our conversations seem to even get very broad in topics since most of us have only taken a course or two on climate change. Climate Conversations did help take the conversation out of a broad range, so that we could talk about more specific happenings, how we would feel about different scenarios, and creatively think more actively. Which did add a different element than our normal conversations.  \n",

Upon settling and exploring the app and crosschecking with the set of instructions, we begin our discussion. It is easy to coordinate since the app gives relative guidelines on how to go about the discussion. It turns out the flow of discussion is much easier and better than earlier anticipated. It is very impressive how my friends air their views on every subject of discussion and, what is more impressive, how we react to everyone’s opinion. Occasionally, we will all side and agree to an opinion raised by one of us and as anticipated, in most times we will all have different opinions on a single subject. We will streamline our thought and ideas to end up on a common ground. All this being in mind, the key of the discussion is to learn together but not change anyone’s opinion. Generally, the discussion turned out very educating. We were all marveled by the extensive information there was to gain on climate change. The conversation took few twists and turns, from being extra serious at times to total humorous moments. The discussion was effectively moderated and since it was between friends, it turned out fun. \n",

Some of the questions that the app asked were both entertaining and somewhat depressing. One of my friends came to UW from New Orleans and was able to witness the drastic weather shifts and intense storms of the last two decades. My friend spoke on how he had to evacuate his hometown due to hurricane Katrina for an extended amount of time. This was when the conversation became more serious because we all knew that my friend had been directly affected by climate change in a very unfortunate situation. \n",

If I had to assign adjectives to the conversations, I would say that they were lighthearted conversations that took the subject matter seriously. It was three of my family members, so I think it would be kind of weird if the conversation became too serious, but we all believe that climate change is a serious issue. I doubt that anyone in my family, immediate or extended, would have any dissenting opinion; I do not have anything like a stereotypical uncle that \"never fails to make conversations awkward.\" We all find the changes in climate and the action (or lack thereof) taken to help mediate these changes to be somewhat concerning. Even if I was to discuss this with friends, I highly doubt that any of them would do something like scoff at the statistics provided. \n",

Although she didn't participate in the whole conversation, my mom recalled to us the gas crisis of the 1970 and how although it was a pain, it was eye-opening to how reliant the world was on finite gas sources. Hurricane Katrina was something that my younger sister and I could not say much on since we were both not all that \"aware\" of the world by then, but my cousin talked about depressing it was. My father also contributed for a second and talked about the damage still present that he saw just a few weeks ago on a business trip. There is a famous Kanye West quote from the charity commercials that I mentioned, but besides that, the only time I could really contribute was talking about the loss of land in Louisiana and how cities combat rising seas. Overall, it was a fun time that was educational for each of us. \n",

I grew up on an island that is barely above sea level off of Oakland that is in serious danger if/when the sea level rises.   This would mean the possibility of all of my friends and their families having to leave our hometown.  This topic came up in our discussion because the winters in the Bay Area do feel different.  Now, it has never exactly been cold in the winter there, but it is definitely getting warmer.  If I’m recalling correctly we had days approaching 70 degrees Fahrenheit while I was home for break last year.

My parents, who both grew up in India, both expressed that climate change and global warming were not things that they ever discussed in grade school/were never really issues that crossed their minds, so it is cool to see that despite that, they have educated themselves on the subject and have come to understand the facts. \n",

      "\n",
      "\t *  The conversation started off kinda lightheartedly because we don't usually talk about climate change and don't really know much about the questions. We started the conversations by talking about what we know and kind of expand on from there. The conversation started off lightheartedly but then slowly turned a bit more serious as we got more and more serious. It took a while for us to get in this serious mood since we rarely discuss in such serious manner. \n",

      "I was doing this conversation with my friends who are in the same age as me. I picked them because thought they would have better knowledge than other people I know since they all go to college like I do. They are also who I would occasionally chat scholarly with about some technical stuff.  \n",
      "\n",
      "\t *  The conversation started out fairly lighthearted, but as the conversation got more data heavy and more political, the mood seemed to quickly turn serious. However, because the group of people who were having the conversation were all family, the conversation stayed relatively respectful and open to other peoples opinions. \n",
      "The four people who were in the conversation were my mother, my father, my sister, and I. Me and my sister vary greatly compared to that of my parents on the topic of climate change and global warming, so it was very interesting to hear the difference in opinion and the difference in facts that were brought up by both sides. There was a point in the conversation where the topic moved more towards politics and less toward climate change, but eventually it returned towards its intended topic. \n",
      "\n",
      "\t *  In general, my conversation went well. I called up a couple of my friends who were back for thanksgiving break to meet up. I told them about this extra credit assignment and they were all willing to give the app a try. One of my friend already reads a lot about climate change so having him be part of the conversation made it more interesting.  \n",
      "\n",
      "It took us awhile until things started to get serious. The conversation was pretty lighthearted at first and we often got off topic as well. However, things started to pick up fifth-teen minutes later. Basically, things got more serious when questions that actually appealed to us came up. My friend Ryan (the person who’s really interested in this topic) surprisingly kept us on topic. He would always add on to the questions or just bring up other related ideas. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\t *  The conversations went quite interestingly, some of the conversations were serious than after awhile they go humorous and not really caring about the topics. It was all lighthearted no one got really into it at all. I talked with one friend and were family members. I did this during thanksgiving before dinner and I feel as if I picked a different time, the conversations might have been more amusing. Reason I bring this up is because everyone was just very hungry and ready to eat some great thanksgiving food! \n",
      "\n",
      "\t *  (I submitted one previously but I by accident did not follow the rubric for at least 2-3 paragraph each question. So I decide the submit this one which has longer answers for each question!) Since it was during the thanksgiving break, the conversation when pretty well with a relaxable tone. However, we were pretty serious on several questions. I talked with my roommates who are also college students. \n",
      "     \n",
      "During the conversation, we firstly sat down around a round table in the living room, turned off the electrical devices besides the laptop, turn the lights off in order to create a focus environment. Then, we typed in our names into the app and started our conversations based on the questions on the app. \n",
      "     \n",
      "The conversation went on smoothly thanks to the logical design of the app. We had some sparkling points on some topics and some tiny disagreements, both of which will be addressed in the following paragraphs.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\t *  I actually decided to pull up the climate conversations application with my informatics group during our study break session and had a really calm conversation of the topics given. Because we have overlapping ideas and beliefs of these topics it went really smoothly but mostly light heartedly. It was very interesting to have a set of ideas and questions given to us as any topic that delves into our climate and earth can be a bit confusing as we do not know where to start, speaking in a casual setting sense. \n",
      "\n",
      "Overall it did feel like I was being very engaged with the topic of discussion but also being able to learn any new concepts is a plus in itself. The climate conversations app is beneficial in terms of thinking about such issues amongst others and having a clear space to talk with friends and family.  \n",
      "\n",
      "\t *  For this assignment, I was talking to family members over Thanksgiving break. The conversation was serious because both of my cousins are both very interested in the topic of climate change.  One studied Political Science at UCSD and is now a lawyer, while the other is a journalist who attended Columbia Journalism school and is now working at Forbes — subsequently, they take political issues like climate change very seriously.  In addition, my family members are from San Francisco and grew up very liberal.  The combination of these qualities ensured that I would have an interesting and in depth discussion on climate change, because I knew they would share similar political beliefs and possess enough knowledge about the topic to carry and be invested in the conversation. \n",
      "\n",
      "At one point in the conversation, when the topics of the drought in California and Hurricane Katrina relief were brought up, the conversation got extremely serious.  California is home for both of my cousins and Angel, the journalist, wrote articles on the numerous natural disasters (Northern California wildfires, Hurricanes in Texas and Puerto Rico, etc) that occurred in the United States in the past couple of months.  As a result, the topic felt more personal and my cousins could contribute even further to the conversations.  I believe personal connections are essential in keeping the conversation going and ensuring that we talk to our friends and families enough in general. \n",
      "\n",
      "\t *  The conversation was pretty forced the whole time just because not many families would be talking about global warming on Thanksgiving. So that made it more serious at the beggining. But once we got through like 5 questions everyone started getting more light-hearted. I was talking with my family. It got better people knew that we were close to the end. \n",

      "The first two conversations, with my Republican roommate and Freshman friend, were lighthearted. My Republican roommate is not very concerned about climate change and believes that while it is good to reduce coal use, the economic implications and job losses are negative consequences that should be seriously considered and weighed in the decision to move towards clean energy. My Freshman friend did not know a lot about climate change, so the conversation was lighthearted in the sense that she was learning things rather than voicing a strong opinion about certain topics.\n",
      "\n",
      "My last conversation was with a friend who is also a National Debate Tournament Varsity Competitor. Last year, the topic was based on whether or not there should be a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions, and as a varsity competitor, he worked approximately 20 hours each week towards research and practice. This conversation was more serious because he was so knowledgable about the topic and had strong opinions, such as the importance of using global average temperature to assess long term trends in climate change rather than relying on how weather \"feels\" on a given day.  \n",

      "\t *  I enjoyed the experience that this app created. Climate change is a topic that is now gaining momentum, but not often talked about with your family. As for our conservation, it certainly had moments of gravity and seriousness, but usually it had more of a lighthearted feeling. Some of the questions, such as the ones regarding strong winters and summers of the past, sparked memories of what we did during those time periods. These moments gave the conversations a cheerful and happy feelings. \n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, our conservation was a fun, but mainly informative.It was certainly interesting to see many different points of view, especially considering the age difference of myself and my parents. They were able to present new information and experiences from a few decades ago that I am unaware of. They certainly have seen more attention surrounding the topic of climate change, but haven't really noticed it in real life yet. For example, the change in temperature or sea level rise hasn't affected their lifestyle.  \n",
      "\n",
      "\t *  I was talking with friends and family members of different ages and who lived in many different places around the world. Some of the questions were interesting which led to an interesting and though-provoking conversation. Slowly, throughout the conversation as we shared stories with one another, we realized that natural disasters really ground us and make us realize how small we are in an enormous world. The conversation made me realize that despite incidences that are not near us, they affect many people. For example, Hurricane Katrina did not directly affect me, but it did displace many families and we should keep that in mind. Natural Disasters can happen to anyone at anytime.  \n",
      "\n",
      "\t *  I thought that the conversations that my friends and family had very very interesting because the questions sparked interesting conversations regarding our past, present and future. At first the conversations were lighthearted but with the questions that asked us to think about what would happen if we were put in a certain situation made us think about how fortunate we are to be where we are. The questions helped us realize that natural disasters really ground us and that natural disasters can happen to anyone at anytime. It reminded us that where we are at a certain moment is based on something greater. For example in the Pacific Northwest, we are due for an earthquake, but we continue with our lives, not worrying about it until it does directly affect us. \n",
      "The themes that recall moments from our lifetime such as Hurricane Katrina or when certain legislative laws were passed make us realize that climate change has been a concurrent issue and that the steps we take now affect how we, as in the global population will live in the future. The members in my conversation were from many different ages and we were all born and brought up in different areas but not we all live in the Pacific Northwest, but certain global natural disasters were on worldwide news which sparked interesting conversation about how our emissions and actions affect the global population.  \n",
      "\n",
      "\t *  My conversation went really well even though it was with a few of my peers who I have shared similar experiences with. It was lighthearted for the most part, but we still managed to take it quite seriously. The friends I brought together I grew up with here in Seattle so our experiences in natural disasters were pretty limited. We did each bring unique opinions and proposed solutions to the discussion though and this made our time together productive.\n",
      "\n",
      "The discussion could have been even better in my opinion if there was greater diversity in those that participated. It would have been extremely interesting and valuable if I had talked to someone who had lived through a devastating event like Hurricane Katrina. It ended up being a very productive discussion anyways because of the many suggested solutions. My friends and I offered up fresh ideas on how to prepare for and see-out disasters and different climate events. \n",
      "\n",
      "\t *  I talked with my friends, and our conversation went pretty lighthearted, fun, and interesting. These questions were requiring some thinking process and discussion. We learned a lot through these questions. My two friends whom I had conversation with, had never actually talked and thought about global warming and natural disasters before, and this was a great opportunity for them and I to think deeply about global warming and natural disasters, such as drought. We also learned that these questions could be applied to real world. \n",
      "\n",
      "I thought it was nice to experience this app and talk about these questions with friends. It felt as we are stepping closer to the problems regarding global warming and natural disasters. Each one of us sometimes had same opinions toward one question, whereas in other times, each one of us had different opinions toward another question. Through expressing our own opinions, we get to think from other's perspectives and learn from each other. Overall, I thought this extra credit assignment was a great source for learning more about global warming and natural disasters, and for learning to make best decision if we face these problems in the future. This extra credit assignment was a great exercise for applying these information to an actual world.  \n",
